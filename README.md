## Inspiration
Health and fitness as been one thing which has got great attention after the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to contribute to supporting people's health as they now move back into their offices and the "busy life".

## What it does
This project provides a forum for people to discuss about their health and makes posts about their fitness schedule and maintain their streaks! The one with 365 streaks will be awarded prizes!
Other than that we have an AI doctor for supporting during first aid and medical tips. Basically someone to understand your medical condition and direct you to the right direction.
Also we have a medical support facility which includes a medical shop, blood bank, ambulance service and hospital bed availability

## How we built it
The website is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Velo by Wix.
The chat bot has been built using python and NLP deep learning model. 
The forum has been built using Velo by Wix for easier backend integration

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was learning Velo as it was my first time using it. It was challenging yet fun

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finally able to see the complete project in action! And managed to get it all done!!

## What we learned
Learned about Velo and how it works and making website using it

## What's next for Fitify
Next aim is to make the bot smart enough for medical diagnosis for common diseases and implement the streak reward system with a live leaderboard!
